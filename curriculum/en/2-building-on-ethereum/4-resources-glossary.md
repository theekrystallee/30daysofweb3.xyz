## Glossary

- **API**: stands for _"application programming interface"_ and is a software intermediary that allows two applications to communicate with each other. 
- **Client/server architecture**: a computing model in which multiple components work in strictly defined roles to communicate.
- **HTTP**: is a protocol, or a definite set of rules, for accessing resources on the web. Resources could mean anything from HTML files to data from a database, photos, text, and so on.
- **Polygon**: a L2(layer-2) scaling solution that achieves scale by utilizing sidechains for off-chain computation and a decentralized network of Proof-of-Stake (PoS) validators.
- **L1 blockchain**: refers to the main blockchain layer such as Ethereum. Layer1 scaling solutions are implemented directly on the main blockchain, thus deriving the name on-chain solutions. Some examples of the on-chain scaling solution involve Consensus Protocol Switch and Sharding.
- **L2 blockchains**: add-on solutions built on the base layer. Thus deriving the name off-chain scaling solution, since they intend to take away workload from the blockchain while utilizing its security.
- **sidechains**: Ethereum-compatible independent blockchains with their own consensus model. Sidechains achieve interoperability with Ethereum by the use of the same EVM. Since they are independent from the main-chain, side chains are responsible for their own security. If a sidechainâ€™s security is compromised, it will pose no impact to the mainchain.
- **Solidity**: programming language used to build Ethereum smart contracts and can be used to deploy smart contracts on multiple chains such as Binance Smart Chain, Polygon, or Avalanche.
- **dApp**: a decentralized application is an application built on a decentralized network that combines a smart contract and a frontend user interface. On Ethereum, smart contracts are accessible and transparent â€“ like open APIs â€“ so your dapp can even include a smart contract that someone else has written.
