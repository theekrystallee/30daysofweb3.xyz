## Glossary

- **a block**: represents a set of transactions across the blockchain.
- **blockchain**: an expanding system that records transaction information in a manner that makes it hard or almost impossible to hack the system. Information gets recorded in blocks, which are like little lists of records.
- **cold wallet**: physical device that stores and protects your private keys. Not as convenient and are less accessible due to costing a fee to purchase, they provide the best security, as no one can access their contents without interacting in person with the hardware wallet. Some popular cold storage wallet options include Ledger and Trezor.
- **crypto wallet**: a storage system for your digital assets like cryptocurrencies, NFTs, and more.
- **gas fee**: a transaction fee that all users must pay in order to perform a function on the blockchain.
- **hot wallet**: one of the most common ways to store crypto assets and is always connected to the internet. This is a very convenient option because it's typically accessed via web, mobile, or desktop. Since hot wallets are always online, they are more vulnerable to attacks. Some popular hot wallet options include MetaMask, Coinbase, and Phantom. 
- **minting**: the process of taking a digital asset like a photo and publishing that asset to the blockchain.
- **private key**: unique key made of a combination of letters and numbers explicitly assigned to the walletâ€™s creator to access the contents of each crypto wallet.
- **public key**: a crypto wallet's public key is the public address of the userâ€™s wallet. Think of it as a business address available publicly on the web. Anyone can use a walletâ€™s public key to look up and verify transaction information, however, personal information is not posted to the blockchain.
- **recovery phrase**: aka "seed phrase" is basically a human-readable form of your wallet's private keyâ€”the unique, secret passcode used to authenticate and encrypt your wallet access.
- **smart contract**: a computer program compiled from code that can control events and actions according to the terms set within the contract's code.
- **testnet**: an instance of a blockchain and only exists as a working prototype used for testing and experimentation without risk to real funds on the mainnet. Some testnet examples include Goerli (Ethereum) and Mumbai (Polygon).
